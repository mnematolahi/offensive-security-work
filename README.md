Tools for Finding Bugs and Vulnerabilities
If you're interested in learning how to find bugs and vulnerabilities in software, then you've come to the right place! This README file is a collection of my favorite tools for discovering and exploiting security flaws.

But before we dive in, I want to emphasize that all the tools listed here should only be used for educational purposes. Do not use them to engage in illegal activities or to harm others.

With that said, let's get started!

Why Command Line Tools?
As someone who's dealt with slow internet speeds and limited hardware, I've found that using command line tools is the best way to handle requests efficiently. Not only that, but they also offer greater anonymity and privacy than graphical tools.

Open Source or Free Only
All the tools listed here are either open source or free to use, so you don't have to spend a lot of money to get started. Plus, you'll have the added benefit of being able to examine and modify the source code to better understand how the tools work.

Tools Overview
The following is a list of my favorite tools for finding bugs and vulnerabilities:

Burp Suite Community Edition - A web application security testing platform that offers both manual and automated testing tools.
Nikto - A web server scanner that checks for vulnerabilities such as outdated software versions and misconfigured servers.
OWASP ZAP - Another web application security testing tool that includes features such as active scanning and passive scanning.
Metasploit Framework - A penetration testing framework that includes a wide range of tools for exploiting vulnerabilities.
Nmap - A network exploration tool that can be used to discover hosts and services on a network.
Wireshark - A network protocol analyzer that can be used to capture and analyze network traffic.
Of course, this is not an exhaustive list, and there are many other great tools out there for finding bugs and vulnerabilities. These are just some of my personal favorites that I've found to be both effective and easy to use.

Conclusion
I hope this list of tools will be useful for anyone who's interested in learning more about security testing. Remember to use these tools responsibly, and always with the intention of improving security, not exploiting vulnerabilities. Happy hunting!
