# Tools for Finding Bugs and Vulnerabilities

If you're interested in learning how to find bugs and vulnerabilities in software, then you've come to the right place! This README file is a collection of my favorite tools for discovering and exploiting security flaws.

But before we dive in, I want to emphasize that all the tools listed here should only be used for educational purposes. Do not use them to engage in illegal activities or to harm others.

With that said, let's get started!

### Why Command Line Tools?

As someone who's dealt with slow internet speeds and limited hardware, I've found that using command line tools is the best way to handle requests efficiently. Not only that, but they also offer greater anonymity and privacy than graphical tools.

### Open Source or Free Only

All the tools listed here are either open source or free to use, so you don't have to spend a lot of money to get started. Plus, you'll have the added benefit of being able to examine and modify the source code to better understand how the tools work.


Remember, these tools should only be used for educational purposes, with no responsibility for illegal use.
