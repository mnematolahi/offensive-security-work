# Tools for Finding Bugs and Vulnerabilities

As a security researcher or ethical hacker, finding bugs and vulnerabilities in software is a critical skill to have. In this Repository , I have compiled a list of some of the most useful and effective tools that can help you identify security issues in software applications.

But before we dive in, I want to emphasize that all the tools listed here should only be used for educational purposes. Do not use them to engage in illegal activities or to harm others.

With that said, let's get started!

### Open Source or Free Only

All the tools listed here are either open source or free to use, so you don't have to spend a lot of money to get started. Plus, you'll have the added benefit of being able to examine and modify the source code to better understand how the tools work.

Remember, these tools should only be used for educational purposes, with no responsibility for illegal use.

## Why Command Line Tools?

Using command line tools is a great way to handle requests efficiently, especially if you're dealing with slow internet speeds or limited hardware resources. They also provide greater anonymity and privacy compared to graphical tools.
