# Tools for Finding Bugs and Vulnerabilities

If you're interested in learning how to find bugs and vulnerabilities in software, then you've come to the right place! This README file is a collection of my favorite tools for discovering and exploiting security flaws.

But before we dive in, I want to emphasize that all the tools listed here should only be used for educational purposes. Do not use them to engage in illegal activities or to harm others.

With that said, let's get started!

### Why Command Line Tools?

As someone who's dealt with slow internet speeds and limited hardware, I've found that using command line tools is the best way to handle requests efficiently. Not only that, but they also offer greater anonymity and privacy than graphical tools.

### Open Source or Free Only

All the tools listed here are either open source or free to use, so you don't have to spend a lot of money to get started. Plus, you'll have the added benefit of being able to examine and modify the source code to better understand how the tools work.


Remember, these tools should only be used for educational purposes, with no responsibility for illegal use.

# Tools for Finding Bugs and Vulnerabilities

As a security researcher or ethical hacker, finding bugs and vulnerabilities in software is a critical skill to have. In this README file, I have compiled a list of some of the most useful and effective tools that can help you identify security issues in software applications.

## Why Command Line Tools?

Using command line tools is a great way to handle requests efficiently, especially if you're dealing with slow internet speeds or limited hardware resources. They also provide greater anonymity and privacy compared to graphical tools.

## Open Source or Free Only

All the tools listed here are either open source or free to use, which means you don't have to spend a lot of money to get started. Plus, you'll have the added benefit of being able to examine and modify the source code to better understand how the tools work.

## Tools Overview

Here are some of my favorite tools for finding bugs and vulnerabilities:

### 1. Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a popular and powerful tool for web application security testing. It provides a wide range of features, including intercepting proxy, web vulnerability scanner, and intruder tool.

### 2. Nmap

Nmap is a versatile tool for network exploration and security auditing. It can be used to discover hosts and services on a network, as well as to identify security issues in networked systems.

### 3. Metasploit

Metasploit is a widely-used tool for developing and executing exploits against vulnerable software. It provides a comprehensive framework for penetration testing and can be used for both manual and automated testing.

### 4. OWASP ZAP

OWASP ZAP is another popular web application security testing tool. It has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, and provides a range of automated and manual testing features.

### 5. Wireshark

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that can be used to examine traffic on a network. It's a great tool for troubleshooting and analyzing network issues, as well as for identifying security vulnerabilities.

These are just a few examples of the many tools available for finding bugs and vulnerabilities. Remember to use them responsibly and only for educational purposes.
